https://llava-vl.github.io/,llava는 GPT-4과 비교했을때 성능 차이가 어떻게되?," LLaVA, which connects a pre-trained CLIP ViT-L/14 visual encoder and large language model Vicuna using a simple projection matrix, was evaluated against GPT-4 on a dataset with 30 unseen images. Each image was associated with three types of instructions: conversation, detailed description, and complex reasoning. The responses from both LLaVA and GPT-4 were rated by GPT-4 based on scores from 1 to 10. The summed score and relative score per type were reported. In the Visual Chat scenario, LLaVA achieved an 85.1% relative score compared with GPT-4, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed self-instruction method in multimodal settings. In the Science QA scenario, LLaVA alone achieved a score of 90.92%, while using text-only GPT-4 as the judge to predict the final answer based on its own previous answers and the LLaVA answers yielded a new SOTA score of 92.53%.",,,2024-03-21 11:27:52.288629
